<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
The name of your command. Used for display in the Command Menu.

Example: `Copy API Keys`

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string" required>
See the example in the Next.js Quickstart where 'logone' is used as a key. One might, for example, set the command name to be "Console Log One", and the key to be logone. The Search component expects a hashmap or JSON object assigning keys to functions, and will then call the corresponding callback using the assigned key.

Example: `copy-keys`
</ResponseField>
